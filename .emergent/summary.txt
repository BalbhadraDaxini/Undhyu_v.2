The previous AI engineer initiated building an e-commerce website, Undhyu.com, for female apparel, integrating with Shopify for product management. The project began as a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, with an early focus on Shopify product fetching and a simple UI. The trajectory shows a significant effort in deploying the application to Vercel/Railway/MongoDB Atlas using a free tier strategy, which faced numerous configuration and build errors.

A crucial pivot occurred when the user clarified My backend is shopify, leading to a temporary shift to a frontend-only deployment. However, the need for payment processing (Razorpay) necessitated re-introducing a backend (FastAPI) for secure API key handling, reverting to a full-stack model. The AI made significant UI changes to fix payment issues, which the user explicitly rejected, demanding the original UI be restored.

The current state is the website is deployed, products are fetching from Shopify, but the cart checkout via Razorpay is failing with a 405 (Method Not Allowed) error, indicating backend API endpoint issues. The user is frustrated with UI changes and repeated deployment debugging.

The user aims to create an attractive, easy-to-navigate e-commerce website named Undhyu.com, specializing in female apparel. Key features include seamless Shopify integration for product and collection management (sarees, lehengas, suits, jewelry), allowing easy addition/removal of products via the Shopify backend. The site requires visible filter sections (price, product type), and a theme reflecting Indian regional specialties (Jaipur, Banaras, Gujarat). Crucially, it must link to Shopify for order processing and leverage the existing Undhyu.com domain.

Recent iterations added a professional, Soch.com-inspired design with a hero section, featured collections, and a product display. The user requested implementing Razorpay for payments and Shiprocket for shipping, and critically, to resolve payment integration issues while preserving the original UI design. The current problem is the cart checkout failing via Razorpay, despite individual product buy now working.

- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **FastAPI:** Python web framework for the backend API.
- **MongoDB:** Database for backend operations (e.g., storing orders).
- **Shopify:** E-commerce platform managing products, orders, and payments.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vercel:** Frontend deployment platform.
- **Razorpay:** Payment gateway for online transactions.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack setup, with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with Shopify as the primary e-commerce platform and MongoDB for backend data (like orders).

**Directory Structure (as per latest successful structure confirmation):**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables for the backend, including MongoDB connection, Shopify store details, and Razorpay API keys (ID and Secret).
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated with correct Shopify Storefront Access Token, and Razorpay LIVE_KEY_ID and LIVE_KEY_SECRET provided by the user.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added to enable Razorpay integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application. It includes API endpoints for status checks, Shopify product/collection fetching (though frontend primarily fetches directly), and, most critically, Razorpay order creation () and payment verification (). It also handles CORS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially set up for Shopify API, then extended to include Pydantic models (, , ) and the Razorpay  and  endpoints. This file is the current point of failure as these endpoints are not being reached/working correctly.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component forming the Undhyu.com website UI. It contains the hero section, product display, collection links, and the shopping cart logic. It directly fetches product data from Shopify using the Storefront API. It also initiates the Razorpay payment process by calling the backend endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup with basic UI.
        -   Later, a more feature-rich/Soch.com-inspired UI was implemented, including state for products, collections, hero image rotation, and cart management. This version incorporated direct Shopify Storefront API calls.
        -   Integrated Razorpay SDK loading and payment initiation logic, calling  and .
        -    was corrected.
        -   A simplified version was temporarily introduced to resolve deployment issues, and then the feature-rich version (with payment logic) was re-added.
        -   The  was explicitly set to .
        -   The UX changes related to cart and checkout (pop-up, CTA buttons) were a point of contention with the user.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Tailwind CSS imports and custom styles for the React application, defining the visual aesthetics of Undhyu.com.
    -   **Changes Made**: Enhanced styling for the feature-rich UI, including product card styling and scroll behavior.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured , , ,  (though later removed/re-added based on simplified  versions), , , ,  are listed. Crucially, it must include the  script.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Vercel deployment configuration file, guiding Vercel on how to build and route the frontend application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Multiple iterations to resolve deployment errors, attempting various configurations for , , . The current state (or intended state based on the last attempt) is likely a simplified version to allow Vercel's auto-detection to work.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Project documentation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to reflect the project's features, tech stack, and live URL.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Shiprocket Integration**: Integration for shipping/logistics was discussed but not implemented.
- **Shopify Collections Setup**: User needs to set up actual collections (sarees, lehengas, suits, jewelry) in their Shopify admin.
- **Adding More Products**: User needs to add more products to their Shopify store for better display on the website.
- **Domain Connection**: While instructions were provided, the  domain is not yet connected to the live Vercel deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the primary focus was on debugging and resolving the Razorpay payment integration for the cart checkout functionality. The user reported the following critical issues:
1.  **Checkout via Add to Cart failing**: When products are added to the cart and the user attempts to check out, it results in a  error for the  endpoint. This indicates the backend is not correctly exposing or receiving requests for this endpoint.
2.  **Static Razorpay screen after direct product payment**: When a user buys a single product directly (presumably bypassing the custom cart and using Shopify's direct checkout, as the custom Razorpay integration is only tied to the custom cart), the Razorpay payment screen remains static even after successful debit. This implies a lack of proper callback handling or UI update after a successful direct payment from Shopify, though this issue might be less critical if the primary problem is the custom cart checkout.
3.  **Cash on Delivery working fine**: This confirms that the Shopify store itself is functional for basic order types not involving the custom payment gateway integration.

The AI engineer's current action is to verify if the  and  endpoints exist and are correctly configured in  on GitHub, as the 405 error strongly suggests they are either missing, commented out, or not being deployed. The user also explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with previous UI changes made by the AI in attempts to fix payment issues, requesting the original UI back. The AI engineer assured the user that future fixes would be minimal and focused solely on backend logic to preserve the UI.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the content of  on the  GitHub repository to ensure the Razorpay endpoints are present and correctly defined, then trigger a redeploy.
