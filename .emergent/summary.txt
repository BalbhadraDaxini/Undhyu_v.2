The AI engineer's trajectory involved developing an e-commerce platform, Undhyu.com, initially as a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application integrated with Shopify. Initial challenges included deployment issues across Vercel/Railway/MongoDB Atlas and persistent 405 errors for Razorpay endpoints. A major architectural shift occurred when the user clarified Shopify as the backend, leading to a temporary frontend-only focus, quickly reverted when payment processing necessitated a FastAPI backend. The AI struggled with UI changes, which the user explicitly rejected, demanding original UI preservation.

Significant progress was made in integrating Razorpay for payments and Shopify Admin API for order creation, addressing critical gaps in the payment flow and order synchronization. The AI debugged and fixed backend routing ( prefix), CORS issues, and refined the frontend's interaction with the new payment logic, including a customer information form. After successfully demonstrating a functional end-to-end payment flow, the user requested a standalone version with mock data and a complete UI/UX overhaul, leading to the current work on restructuring the entire frontend layout.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement is an attractive, easy-to-navigate e-commerce site, Undhyu.com, for female apparel, integrating with Shopify for product and collection management (sarees, lehengas, suits, jewelry). The site needs visible filter sections (price, type), a theme reflecting Indian regional specialties, and seamless Shopify order processing. Recent additions included a Soch.com-inspired design, Razorpay for payments, and Shiprocket for shipping.

The current focus shifted to fixing cart checkout issues via Razorpay, preserving the original UI. The user explicitly reported cart checkout failing with a 405 error for , and a static Razorpay screen after direct product payments. The AI successfully implemented full Razorpay integration, including customer details collection and Shopify order creation via Admin API. The latest request is to restructure the entire homepage with specific sections (Header, Hero, Collections, New Arrivals, Uniqueness Highlight) and implement dedicated category pages with filtering and product cards, while maintaining existing UI/UX.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack setup with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, interacting with Shopify and MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include Shopify Admin API access token, Shopify store domain, and Razorpay LIVE_KEY_ID/LIVE_KEY_SECRET.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was confirmed, and  was added implicitly through  changes for Admin API.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI application with API endpoints. Handles product/collection fetching from Shopify (though frontend fetches directly), Razorpay order creation (), payment verification (), and now Shopify Admin API integration to create orders after successful Razorpay payments. It also manages CORS.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Crucially, the Razorpay endpoints (, ) were prefixed with  to fix the 405 error, e.g., .
        -   Added logic for Shopify Admin API integration to create orders on Shopify after Razorpay payment success.
        -   CORS configuration was updated to include the frontend's origin () to resolve cross-origin issues.
        -   A  endpoint was added to verify all integrations.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component. Handles UI, direct Shopify Storefront API calls for products, cart management, and Razorpay payment initiation.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated Razorpay SDK loading and payment initiation logic, calling  and .
        -    was explicitly set to the correct  from .
        -   Implemented a  (modal) to collect user details (name, email, phone, address, pincode) before payment.
        -   Modified  to correctly handle direct product purchases by passing the item as a cart.
        -   Enhanced payment success/failure handling with user feedback.
        -   Extensive debugging and refactoring for compilation errors, particularly  and brace mismatch, leading to several attempts at fixing the file's structure. Eventually, a rollback was performed and a simpler working version was restored before the new structural requirements were introduced.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Tailwind CSS imports and custom styles.
    -   **Changes Made**: Likely minor styling adjustments for new forms/modals.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Node.js dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured  is present for API calls.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Vercel deployment configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Unspecified in detail, but iterated multiple times for deployment issues.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Project documentation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to reflect features and tech stack.
-   ****: A new, separate directory was created to house a complete self-contained React application with mock data.
    -   ****: Contains the main React app logic, with hardcoded mock products and simulated payment/order storage (localStorage). All external API calls are removed.
    -   ****: Standard React app dependencies for a self-contained project.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Shiprocket Integration**: Integration for shipping/logistics was discussed but not implemented.
-   **Shopify Collections Setup**: User needs to set up actual collections (sarees, lehengas, suits, jewelry) in their Shopify admin.
-   **Adding More Products**: User needs to add more products to their Shopify store for better display on the website.
-   **Domain Connection**: The  domain is not yet connected to the live Vercel deployment.
-   **Implement new UI/UX structure**: Restructure the homepage and create dedicated category pages as per the latest user request.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a series of critical issues:
1.  **Razorpay 405 error**: This was fixed by ensuring the  prefix was correctly added to backend Razorpay endpoints in .
2.  **Shopify Admin API Integration**: The backend was enhanced to use the Shopify Admin API (with the provided  token) to create orders in Shopify upon successful Razorpay payments.
3.  **Customer Information Collection**: A  was implemented as a modal in  to collect user details (name, email, phone, address, city, pincode, country) before proceeding to Razorpay.
4.  **Buy Now functionality**: The  function in  was updated to correctly handle individual product purchases.
5.  **Razorpay payment flow**: The frontend's Razorpay integration was refined for better success/failure handling and user feedback, ensuring the Razorpay page proceeds after payment.
6.  **CORS issues**: The backend's CORS configuration was updated to allow requests from the frontend's domain, resolving product loading issues.

After fixing these issues and ensuring the primary  application was fully functional with integrated payments, the user then requested a **standalone version of the e-commerce website without any external API dependencies**. The AI successfully created this, producing a  archive containing a self-contained React app with mock product data and simulated payments using local storage.

The latest request is a significant UI/UX restructuring for the main application, specifically:
-   **Homepage Structure**: Header (Logo, sticky Navigation: Sarees, Lehengas, Kurtis, Jewelry, New Arrivals, Collections), Hero Section, Collections Section, New Arrivals Section (with Add to Cart/Buy Now on cards), and a new Uniqueness Highlight section.
-   **Navigation & Category Pages**: Each navigation item to route to a dedicated page (, , etc.) with a left sidebar for filters (Price, Color, Fabric/Material, Size, Occasion, Region) and a right-side product grid (2-4 per row), featuring Image, Name, Price, Rating, Add to Cart, and Buy Now buttons.
-   **Cart & Checkout**:  adds to cart with header badge update;  redirects to checkout with preloaded item.
-   **Responsiveness & UI Consistency**: Maintain current styling, color palette, typography, and spacing, ensuring all new sections and pages are responsive.

The AI engineer has just acknowledged this new, extensive UI/UX restructuring request and has started working on creating an updated version with proper navigation, category pages, and the new homepage structure within a new  directory, beginning with  and . This is the immediate task currently being worked on.
